// The panel the shell opens an app folder in, with the folder taken out of it.
//
// This is the shell's AppFolderDialog (appDisplay.js:2461-2523) — the shade,
// the panel that zooms out of the icon it was opened from, the grab, the
// click-away, the settle — with the folder's grid and its name entry removed.
// What goes inside is the subclass's: the detail pane (detailDialog.js) or the
// modal library's grid (libraryWindow.js). The shape and shade are the
// shell's own `app-folder-dialog` style, so the panel is the folder's; its
// corners follow `corner-radius` as every rounded surface here does.
//
// Two things the folder has no need of are options here. `dieWithSource` is
// the folder's own behaviour — the panel goes the moment the icon it came out
// of unmaps — which the "modal" detail turns off, since it is meant to
// outlive the overview that was up when the pick was made. And a panel can be
// opened with no source at all, which fades it in centred (`_fadeIn`) rather
// than zooming it out of a tile that is not there.
//
// `inset` is the frame the panel keeps around whatever it holds, as a folder's
// panel frames its grid; `_sizePanel` adds it back to what it measures inside.
//
// What goes *behind* the panel is the folder's too, and it is asked rather
// than assumed — see `folderLook` below.
//
// Sizing is in two halves: `_budget()` is the room the work area leaves, and
// `_sizePanel()` — the subclass's — is what it makes of it. Whatever it sets
// is the panel's size at rest, which `_settle` restores.
