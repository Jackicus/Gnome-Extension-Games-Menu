// One game up close, popped up the way the shell opens an app folder: the
// tile fades away, the panel zooms out of its artwork over a shade, and a
// click on the shade or Escape zooms it back. This is `panel.js` — the
// shell's folder panel — with the detail pane inside it where the folder
// holds its grid, and nothing else added.
//
// It serves both places a pick can open in (`detail-opens-in`), either of
// which either library can use. In "menu" it is the folder exactly: hosted
// where the pick was made — over the overview when the pick came from there,
// over the desktop when it came out of the modal library's panel — and gone
// the moment its tile unmaps, as a folder goes with its icon. "modal" is the
// same panel with two flags turned: it is hosted in `uiGroup` always (the
// overview is hidden first, and the pick then has no tile to come out of, so
// it fades in centred) and it does not die with its source, so a change of
// workspace leaves it up. Escape or a click away is what closes it either way.
//
// It opens in two moves, so that the first is the folder's exactly. The panel
// zooms out of the tile at the width of the artwork alone — poster-shaped, as
// the folder's square panel is icon-shaped, so the zoom is near enough uniform
// — and only then opens out sideways onto the title, the facts and the
// details, which were built while it zoomed. Closing mirrors it: the second
// column goes, the panel narrows back to its artwork, and that is what zooms
// home. Nothing here waits on anything: the list fills as it scrolls.
