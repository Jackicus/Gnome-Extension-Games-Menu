// the stylesheet. Every rounded surface therefore takes its radius from here,
// as an inline style; the stylesheet keeps the same numbers as fallbacks for
// the instant before that is applied.
//
// The parts are offsets from the artwork's radius, in the proportions the
// stylesheet already used: the pop-up panel is the roundest thing on screen,
// badges the tightest. There are only as many as the eye can tell apart —
// posters and list rows both asked for a radius within two pixels of each
// other, so they share the artwork's and anything unnamed falls back to it.
