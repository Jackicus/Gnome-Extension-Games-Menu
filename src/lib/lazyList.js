// Filling a scroll view a batch at a time.

// of dozen. Building all of them costs a St.Button subtree each, laid out and
// styled in one go on the compositor's own main loop — the stall lands exactly
// when the library or a game is opened, which is the moment the panel is
// meant to be animating.
//
// So: build enough to cover what is on screen, then more as the view nears its
// end. Each batch is its own main-loop iteration rather than one long block.
