// Motion vocabulary derived from GNOME Shell's own.
//
// The shell animates almost everything with ease-out-quad over 250ms (overview,
// workspace switch, app grid pages) and pops windows in with ease-out-expo over
// 150ms from 94% scale. The durations below (120/200) are the extension's own
// steps, not shell constants -- they are tuned to feel of a piece with the
// shell's 250ms/150ms rather than copied from them, so the same handful of
// curves and durations is what makes the extension feel native rather than
// "animated".
//
// actor.ease() is the shell's own helper: it honours the "enable animations"
// setting and the slow-down factor, so nothing here needs to check them.
