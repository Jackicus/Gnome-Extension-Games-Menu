Show what the extension has logged recently.

Time window requested: $ARGUMENTS

Run `./scripts/dev.sh logs "<window>"`, using the window above — or `10 min ago` if
it's empty. Anything systemd accepts works (`5 min ago`, `today`, `09:00`).

Summarise what happened rather than dumping every line: how many enable/disable
cycles, whether the library was rebuilt, and any errors or stack traces in full.
Exceptions inside a GNOME extension only ever surface here, never in a terminal,
so this is the place to look when something silently does nothing. Media
Libraries logs to the same journal as `[Media Libraries]`; those lines are not
this extension's.
