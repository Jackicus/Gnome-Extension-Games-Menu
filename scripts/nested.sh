#
# The nested shell is a complete second GNOME Shell with its own session bus. It
# reads the same ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions, so it picks up new UUIDs at
# its own startup -- and if the extension throws, it dies instead of your session.
#
# It always runs headless: this mutter build has no windowed (nested) backend.
# The mirror is a screencast of its virtual monitor, played on the real desktop
# through PipeWire, which both sessions share. That is how you watch along.
#
# Nothing is left behind on the desktop: the mirror closes when the shell stops or
# dies, and a shell started from a Claude Code session stops itself after
# GAMES_MENU_NESTED_IDLE seconds (default 600, 0 = never) without a command here,
# and when that session ends (the SessionEnd hook runs 'session-end').
#
# Other extensions' repos may have nested shells of their own, driven by
# copies of this script, and they can all run at once. Everything that names
# this one is its own — the run dir, the Wayland display, the bus
# dbus-run-session makes — and every process this script looks for is matched
# by this repo's own paths, so a stop here never takes another one down.
